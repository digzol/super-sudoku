Super sudoku is an image I found online of a giant sudoku grid. Completing the puzzle by editing the image on my phone was a bit too tedious, so I created an app for this purpose.

Live version is accessible [here](https://digzol.github.io/super-sudoku/).

# Build

The `gh-pages` package builds the app to be hosted on Github Pages. With package.json configured properly, run:
```
$ npm run deploy
```
If successfull, a `gh-pages` branch will be created to be selected in the Pages settings.
