Super sudoku is an image I found online of a giant sudoku grid. Completing the puzzle by editing the image on my phone was a bit too tedious, so I created an app to easily do this.
Numbers entered are saved locally in your browser so it's safe to come back to it later.

# Build

The `gh-pages` package builds the app to be hosted on Github Pages. If the package.json is set up correctly, simply run:
```
$ npm run deploy
```
If successfull, this will create a `gh-pages` branch that can be selected in the Pages settings.

Live version is accessible [here](https://digzol.github.io/super-sudoku/).
